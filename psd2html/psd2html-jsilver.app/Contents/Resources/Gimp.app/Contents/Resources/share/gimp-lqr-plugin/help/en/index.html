		The Liquid Rescale plugin is an implementation of the content-aware resizing by
		seam carving algorithm by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir.
	</p>
        <p>
		It aims at resizing pictures non uniformly while preserving the features of the picture,
		i.e. avoiding distortion of the important parts of the picture.
		It can also be used to remove portions of the picture in a consistent way.
	</p>
        <p>
		It works both ways (enlarging is performed in successive steps), and
		it can use extra layers as masks to select which features of the image should be
		preserved and which should be discarded.
	</p>
	<p>
		See also <a href="#seam_carving">Appendix: The seam carving technique in brief</a> at the end
		of this page for an introduction to seam carving concepts.
	</p>
	<p>
		The plugin works on the active layer or floating selection. It can also operate on multiple layers
		through the <i>"Filter all layers"</i> plugin and using the GIMP Animation Package facilities for
		video editing.
	</p>
	<p>
 		The plugin only works on whole layers, if a selection is present it is saved to a channel and removed.
		If the layer has a transparency mask, an option is given to select the behaviour (apply/discard).
	</p>
	<p>
		The plugin can also be operated in batch mode from the command line, see
		<a href="#batch">this section</a> for details.

	<h3>Select new width and height</h3>
	<p>
		<div>
			In this section it is possible to choose the final size.
			It is advisable to rescale always in one direction at a time. If both 
			the width and the height are changed, rescaling is performed by default on the
			width first, then on the height. This can be changed in the <i>"Advanced"</i> tab.
		</div>
		<div>
			The three small buttons on the right can be used to reset the size parameters
			to the image size (top) or set them to the last used values (middle), or to
			switch to the interactive mode (bottom - see the
			<a href="#interactive">corresponding section</a> for more details).
		</div>
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the final size can be set automatically when removing objects, see below.
	</p>


	<h3>Feature masks</h3>
	<h4>Quick guide</h4>
	<p>
		The easiest way to manually select the features of the image that you want to protect
		or discard is the following:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Select the layer you want to resize (not a floating selection) and invoke the plugin
			</li><li>
				Press the <i>"New"</i> button in the <b>"Feature preservation mask"</b> section
				(this will create a transparent layer, with 50% opacity, and pick an appropriate
				colour).
			</li><li>
				Put the plugin dialog aside and paint on the areas of the image you want to preserve
			</li><li>
				Go back to the plugin dialog and press the refresh button to see the mask you painted
			</li><li>
				Repeat everything for the features to discard
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to remove portions of the image, you can press one of the two
		buttons besides the <i>"Auto size"</i> label to determine
		the final size automatically (this is only reliable when dealing with very simple
		masks).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Note #1:</b> object removal is only possible when shrinking. By default,
		feature discard masks are ignored when enlarging, because in that case the masked
		areas would be inflated rather then removed. If you actually want to get this effect,
		you need to unset the corresponding option in the <i>"Advanced"</i> tab (or use
		interactive mode).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Note #2:</b> preservation of features is not possible if enlarging too much,
		because the inflation process is the exact reverse of the shrinking process,
		so the maximum amount of pixels you can add to a layer corresponds to the 
		amount of pixels which are not protected. For example, if you have a 1000 pixel
		wide image and you have marked a 800 pixel wide area for protection, the final
		width should be less than 1200 pixels. If you want to enlarge more, do it in
		steps, or set the <i>"Max enlargment per step"</i> option in the advanced settings
		to an appropriate value.
	</p>
		

	<h4>Full description</h4>
	<p>
		<div>
			In the <b>"Feature preservation mask"</b> section
			it is possible to specify if there are regions of the image which
			should be preserved from modification, by checking the <i>"Activate feature preservation"</i>
			box, and by choosing a layer among the ones which belong to the current image (excluding the active one)
			in the <i>"Available layers"</i> menu.
			The <i>"New"</i> button creates a transparent layer with 50% opacity and an appropriate name,
			and sets it as the selected layer mask (note that this fails if the plugin is invoked on a
			floating selection, because GIMP does not allow to work on other layers in such case).
			It also sets the foreground colour to green; the previous colour is restored when the
			dialog is closed.
		</div>
		<div>
			The intensity of the effect of the mask on each pixel is obtained as
			the average on the pixel's colour channels, multiplied by the alpha channel. Thus, for an RGB layer
			with an alpha channel, the maximum value is achieved on white pixels, while black ones
			and transparent ones are ignored.
			In general, it is advisable to use a single colour for each mask, and, if needed, fine-tune the strenght
			of the mask for different areas by using the transparency value, instead of lightness or saturation.
		</div>
		<div>
			The size and position of the selected layer can be arbitrary, the plugin will only use
			those portions which overlap with the active layer.
			The <i>"Strength"</i> scale can be used as a global parameter to modulate the feature preservation.
			Note that thinner selection areas (in the sense of the resizing) need higher strength values, and
			vice-versa.
		</div>
	</p>
	<p>
		<div>
			The <b>Feature discard selection</b> section is nearly identical to the previous one,
			but the effect is reversed, and the default colour for the <i>"New"</i> button is red instead of green.
		</div>
		<div>
			Furthermore, there are two additional buttons besides the <i>"Auto size:"</i> label, which can be used for
			"quick &amp; dirty" object removals. When one of these buttons is pressed, the plug-in tries to compute the exact
			amount of rescaling which is needed in order to remove the areas of the image marked by the current discard mask,
			and sets the final size accordingly (in the <b>"Select new width and height"</b> section).
			These buttons will always produce a single-direction rescale: the <i>"Width"</i> button changes just the width
			and sets the height to its original value, the <i>"Height"</i> button does the opposite.
		</div>
		<div>
			Note that this option is only suitable for na√Øve object removals, and it may fail if the masks are
			non-trivial.
		</div>
		<div>
			<i>[Technical information: the final size is determined by simply finding out the maximum number of
			pixels in a line for which the mask value is above a given threshold, which is set to the 50% of a full
			RGB colour (e.g. red in the default setting).]</i>
		</div>

	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>
		<img title="Output" alt="Output" src="../images/dialog2.jpg">
	</p>
	<p>
		This tab has a number of options related to the output of the plugin.
	</p>
	<p>
		<dl>
		<dt>Output on a new layer</dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies if the resized image should be written on a new layer.
			By default, it is off.
		</dd>
		<dt>Resize image canvas</dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies whether the image canvas should be resized to meet the new size of the active
			layer. By default, it is on.
		</dd>
		<dt>Resize auxiliary layers</dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies whether the layers used to manually select the features of the image
			or to specify a rigidity mask will be resized along with the active layer.
			If this option is checked, those layers will be first cropped to the active layer's size,
			then they will undergo the same seam carving and inserting process as the active layer.
			By default, it is on, but it is only active when some layers are selected in
			the <i>"Feature masks"</i> tab or if a rigidity mask is being used (see below).
		</dd>
		<dt>Output the seams on a new layer</dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies whether to create a new layer with the seams map in interactive mode.
			The two buttons on the right of it let the user choose the seams colour range.
			The seams are computed on the original layer as far as they are needed for the new size
			(e.g. there will be 100 seams if reducing or enlarging by 100 pixels), the remaining
			areas are transparent. In order to read the result, use this option together with
			<i>"Output on a new layer"</i>, and overlay the seams map to the original layer.
			If you rescale in two directions at once, you will obtain two maps, but the second
			one will be computed over an invisible intermediate image, so this is not very useful.
			The same applies in the case you choose to rescale back to the original size with LqR,
			or when the resizing goes beyond the limit set with <i>"Max enlargment per step"</i>.
			Note that this option is ignored in interactive mode, except for the colours you choose,
			which are used when dumping the seam maps manually.
		</dd>
		<dt>Scale back to the original size</dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies whether to perform a scale back operation after the liquid rescale operation
			has been performed.
			This can be useful for example for object removal and content enhancement.
			If this option is checked, a menu appears below it to let the user
			choose the details of the operations: it is possible to revert to the opriginal width
			and height using either liquid rescale or the standard scaling algorithm, or it is
			possible to perform a uniform scaling with the standard algorithm and reach back only
			the original width, or only the original height.
			Note that this option is ignored in interactive mode.
		</dd>
		</dl>
	</p>
	<h3>Advanced</h3>
	<p>
		This tab has some options which can be used to tweak the plugin behavior.
	</p>
	<h4>Seams control</h4>
	<p>
		<img title="Seams control" alt="Seams control" src="../images/dialog3.jpg">
	</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>Max transversal step</dt>
	<dd>
		<div>
		This option lets you choose the maximum transversal step that the pixels in the seams can
		take. In the standard algorithm, corresponding to the default value step = 1, each pixel
		in a seam can be shifted by at most one pixel with respect to its neighbors.
		This implies that the seams can form an angle of at most 45 degrees with respect
		to their base line.
		</div>
		<div>
		Increasing the step value lets you overcome this limit, but may lead to the
		introduction of artifacts. In order to balance the situation, you can use
		the rigidity setting.
		</div>
	</dd>
	<dt>Overall rigidity</dt>
	<dd>
		<div>
		Use this value to give a negative bias to the seams which are not straight. May be useful
		to prevent distortions in some situations, or to avoid artifacts from pixel skipping
		(it is better to use low values in such case). This setting applies to the whole
		selected layer if no rigidity mask is used.
		</div>
		<div>
		<i>[Technical information: the bias is proportional to the difference in the transversal
		coordinate between each two successive points, elevated to the power of 1.5, and summed up
		for the whole seam.]</i>
		</div>
	</dd>
	<dt>Use a rigidity mask</dt>
	<dd>
		<div>
		It is possible to specify different rigidity values for different areas of the image,
		using an auxiliary layer, by following the same procedure used to specify the feature masks
		(the default colour for newly created rigidity masks is blue).
		If a rigidity mask is specified, its value at each pixel (computed in the same way as
		for the feature masks) will be used as a rigidity coefficient, to be multiplied with the
		overall one.
		</div>
		<div>
		Note #1: transparent (or black) areas in the rigidity mask always correspond to
		0 rigidity, no matter what the overall value is.
		</div>
		<div>
		Note #2: rigid areas have a slight repulsive effect on seams, similar to that
		of a preservation mask. In order to compensate for this, you may use a discard mask.
		</div>
	</dd>
	<dt>Gradient function</dt>
	<dd>
		It is possible to choose which function
		is to be used to calculate the energy map of the image. For each pixel in the image,
		the x,y components of the gradient are computed from the pixel's four nearest neighbors.
		The exact form of the energy map depends on the choice of the gradient function, and
		this in turn determines which elements of the image are more important, and should
		thus be preserved, and which are not, and can be removed (if shrinking) or inflated
		(if enlarging). Using the <i>Null</i> function in conjunction with the feature preservation
		mask can be used to override completely the automatic feature detection, thus
		allowing the user to generate his own energy map (e.g. by another plugin).
	</dd>
	</dl>
	<h4>Operations control</h4>
	<p>
		<img title="Operations control" alt="Operations control" src="../images/dialog4.jpg">
	</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>Max enlargement per step</dt>
	<dd>
		This option sets the maximum enlargement (in percent) which will be performed in a
		single rescale step. When the final size is greater than this, the plugin will automatically
		stop and restart the rescaling as many times as needed. You might need to reduce this
		value if you have large preservation masks (but then the same areas will be affected
		over and over by the rescaling).
	</dd>
	<dt>Rescale order</dt>
	<dd>
		When rescaling in both directions at the same time, it can be chosen whether to resize
		first in the horizontal and then in the vertical direction, or vice versa.
	</dd>
	<dt>Ignore dicard mask when enlarging</dt>
	<dd>
		The effect of the discard mask is reversed when the plugin is used for enlarging an image;
		as this is normally undesirable, they are ignored by default when the
		first scaling direction is to be enlarged (in such cases, a small warning icon will
		appear in the <i>"Feature discard mask"</i> section).
		Unset this option if you want to override this behaviour.
		Note that this option is ignored in interactive mode.
	</dd>
	</dl>
      <h3>Using the plugin for video and animation editing</h3>
      <h4>Using the plugin with GAP</h4>
      <p>
	      	The plugin can take advantage of the GIMP Animation Package (GAP) for video editing,
		making it possible to apply liquid rescaling to all the frames of a video (please refer
		to the GAP documentation for instructions about video editing in GIMP).
      </p>
      <p>
		Note however that the GAP facilities only allow to select the working layer, but the
		liquid rescale plugin needs auxiliary layers as well to work at its full potential.
		In order to work around this problem, auxiliary layers are set according to their names:
		therefore, if you want to use a preservation mask in each frame, for example, you should
		take care that all the layers which you intend to use as such have the same name in all
		of the frames. The same applies to discard masks and rigidity masks.
      </p>
      <p>
	        <div>
		In order to use liquid rescale on all frames, you need select <i>"Frame Modify"</i> in
		the <i>"Video"</i> menu; this will open a dialog: in the <i>"Function"</i> section select <i>"Apply filter
		on layer(s)"</i>, then set appropriate rules for layer selection and frame range and
		click OK. Another dialog will appear, asking you to choose a filter: select
		<i>plug-in-lqr</i>, then choose either <i>"Apply constant"</i> or <i>"Apply varying"</i>.
		</div>
		<div>
		In the latter case, you will be presented the liquidrescale plugin dialog twice, once
		for the first frame and once for the last one: these will set the extreme values for 
		all the graded parameters (such as sizes, strengths, rigidity etc.), and
		intermediate values will be used in the intermediate frames (for example, if you set
		the width to 100% for the first frame and 110% for the last one, and there are 11 frames
		overall, intermediate frames will have widths of 101%, 102%, 103% and so on). However, all the
		on/off options (such as the resize order, the auxiliary layer names etc.)
		will be taken from the <u>last</u> dialog for all the intermediate frames.
		</div>
      </p>
      <h4>Applying the plugin to all layers (e.g. for animations)</h4>
      <p>
      		It is also possible to apply the plugin to all the layers in a given image (for example
		when editing an animation), using the option <i>"Filter all layers..."</i> from the
		<i>"Filters"</i> menu and choosing <i>"plug-in-lqr"</i> in the dialog which appears.
		Operations follow the rules explained in the GAP section; however, you will run into
		problems if using auxiliary layers as masks, since the plugin will be applied
		to those as well.
      </p>
      
      <a name="interactive"></a>
      <h2>User interface description (interactive mode)</h2>
      <p>
	      <img title="Interactive interface" alt="Interactive interface" src="../images/dialog_interactive.jpg">
      </p>
      <p>
		Pressing the interactive button in the main plugin dialog switches the plugin to interactive mode, and
		applies the current settings, including the current size settings. In interactive mode only the size
		can be modified (and modifications will be applied immidiately), and some options are ignored:
		<ul>
			<li>Output the seams (you have to do it manually, see below)</li>
			<li>Scale back to the original size</li>
			<li>Ignore discard mask when enlarging</li>
		</ul>
		Use the <i>"Back"</i> button to get back to the main dialog.
      </p>
      <h3>Select new width and height</h3>
      <p>
		This section includes the controls for the layer size. The application of the changes is almost immediate, but
		only after the buttons are released; this means that, if you have activated the chain button to preserve the
		aspect ratio, the results will be different if you do many small steps or you do the rescaling in one sweep.
		The reset button on the right brings the size back to the initial value: this recovers the original image if
		the map was never reset, but it will produce a different image otherwise (see also the Map section below).
      </p>
      <h3>Map</h3>
      <p>
		The additional <i>"Map"</i> section in the dialog is about the internal seam map which the plugin uses
		for its computations. Any map has an orientation (depending on the scaling direction), a reference
		value (the one it was initialized with) and a range. The map allows to rescale almost in real-time within
		its given range and along its direction; going beyond the current range will produce the updating of the map.
		The maps store all the scaling information about the specified range: therefore, going back to the reference
		value will reproduce the initial image. However, a new map is generated automatically any time the direction
		of the scaling is changed, or when the size exceeds the max enlargment per step; when this happens, all
		previous information is lost.
		There are three buttons in this section:
		<dl>
			<dt>Info button</dt>
			<dd>Displays or hides information about the internal seam map</dd>
			<dt>Reset button</dt>
			<dd>
			Force the map reset. This is like restarting the plugin from the current situation.
			For example, if you change the size, then press this
			button, then press the reset button in the size section, you will have the same result as using
			the <i>"Scale back to the original size"</i> option (with the <i>"liquid rescale"</i> setting) in
			non-interactive mode.
			</dd>
			<dt>Dump seam map button</dt>
			<dd>
			This button can be used to view the current seam map. Its effect is the same as that of
			the <i>"Output the seams"</i> option in noninteractive mode, only you need to do it manually, and
			it prints out one map at a time. The first time you press this button in a session, a new layer will
			be crated to hold the map, but if you press it again the new map will take the place of the old one.
			In order to make sense of the result, you have to bring the layer you're working on to its reference
			size after the dump, and overlay the map on it.
			This button is only active for RGB images.
			</dd>
		</dl>
      </p>

      <a name="batch"></a>
      <h2>Using the plugin in batch mode</h2>
      <p>
              The plugin comes with some convenience scripts which make it easy to operate it the on
              files from the command line.
              You can find a description of the scrits arguments by using the <i>"Procedure browser"</i> from
              the <i>"Help"</i> menu in GIMP and looking for <i>batch-gimp-lqr</i>, <i>batch-gimp-lqr-full</i> and
              <i>batch-gimp-lqr-full-use-id</i>; the meaning of the options should be obvious from knowing how the
              standard interface works.
      </p>
      
      <a name="seam_carving"></a>
      <h2>Appendix: The seam carving technique in brief</h2>
      <p>
	      The plugin works by finding so-called "seams" over an image, i.e. continuous, zig-zagged lines transversing
	      the image from top to bottom ("vertical" seams), or from left to right ("horizontal" seams). When one such seam,
	      say a vertical one, is removed from an image (the "carving" operation), the width of the image is reduced by one
	      pixel. Removing horizontal seams reduces the height. Iterating such operations (find a seam and remove it), one
	      can reduce the image size at will. Collecting together all the seams which were carved from an image, in their
	      respective order, constitutes what is called a "seams map".
      </p>
      <p>
	      Mirroring the carving process, by <i>inserting</i> additional seams besides the ones which are found
	      by the algorithm, instead of removing them, image enlargement can be obtained, too. The meaning of the seam
	      map is reversed in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
	      In order to get good results form this technique, the main issue is finding which are the most suitable seams
	      to carve or to insert. If the aim is simply to change the proportions of the image without affecting too much the
	      content, for example, "good" seams will be those which don't cross important features of the image, and instead pass
	      through a background landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
	      By default, the plugin is tries to find the seams which cross the lowest-contrast areas 
	      (how this happens exactly is specified by the gradient function choice in the <i>"Advanced"</i> tab).
	      Therefore, each pixel of the image is assigned a so-called "energy value": the higher the contrast, the higher
	      the energy, and seams are less likely to cross high-energy areas.
      </p>
      <p>
	      Since in many cases this simple contrast-based method is not optimal, the energy function can be "biased" by
	      the user, who can decide that some areas should have a higher energy (using a preservation masks) or, on the
	      contrary, that they should have a lower energy (using a discard mask), and therefore effectivily "drive" the
	      seams and the whole process.
      </p>
      <p>
	      Rigidity masks work in a similar way, but the energy bias that they add does not only depend on the mask value
	      over each pixel, but also on how much the seams which try to cross that pixel are straight.
      </p>
      <p>
	      One intuitive picture is as such: the seams try to get from one side to the other of the image keeping on a
	      path with an energy as low as possible; preservation masks have the effect of putting a barrier on their path,
	      which, if high enough, deviates the seams away from it; discard mask, on the other hand, are like valleys which
	      attract seams. Rigidity masks have the effect of putting barriers besides each seam, which tend to make
	      it straighter.
